- thanks to Or Sofer for the idea of Templates.
_ thanks to my brother for devoting some minutes to help me to debug and fix the code
  (Of course, I did myself the main part of the debugging. My brother helped me with 2 issues:
  a. to pass my implementation of the template classes to the header file (instead of the source file).
  b. to pass the initialization of classes' members to be before the curly brackets of the constructors.)
